## Introduction
This portfolio documents the practical exercises completed during the course,
highlighting key projects,
code samples, and reflections on the learning process. Each section provides a clear
demonstration of
practical engagement, challenges faced, and problem-solving strategies applied. The
exercises correspond
to weekly seminar tasks and demonstrate a high level of competency in implementing
networking solutions
using Python.
## Practical Exercises
### NOS WK02: Python Fundamentals
- **Key Topics Covered:** Data types, loops, functions, conditionals
- **Exercises:**
 - Implemented basic mathematical operations
 - Created and manipulated lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 # Function to check password strength
 def check_password_strength(password):
 if len(password) < 8 or not any(c.isupper() for c in password) or not
any(c.islower() for c in password) or not any(c in "@#$%" for c in password):
 return "Weak password"
 return "Strong password"
 ```
### NOS WK03: Application Layer in Networks
- **Key Topics Covered:** Sockets, HTTP requests, API communication
- **Exercises:**
 - Fetched and analyzed website IP addresses
 - Developed a basic HTTP client using Python sockets
 - Created a Python script for tracing network routes
 - Implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the `requests` library
- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 import requests
 response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
 print(response.json())
 ```
### NOS WK04: Transport Layer (UDP & APIs)
- **Key Topics Covered:** UDP communication, API data retrieval
- **Exercises:**
 - Implemented a UDP server and client for real-time message exchange
 - Integrated API data retrieval with UDP transmission
 - Secured UDP communications using authentication and encryption
- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 import socket
 server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
 server_socket.bind(('localhost', 65433))
 print("UDP Server running...")
 while True:
 data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(2048)
 print(f"Received from {addr}: {data.decode()}")
 ```
### NOS WK05: Transport Layer (TCP & Secure Communication)
- **Key Topics Covered:** TCP, multithreading, encryption
- **Exercises:**
 - Built a TCP server and client for data transmission
 - Implemented file transfer over TCP
 - Developed a basic chat application using threading
 - Added encryption to secure messaging using the `cryptography` library
- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
 key = Fernet.generate_key()
 cipher = Fernet(key)
 encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(b"Hello, Secure World!")
 print(encrypted_message)
 ```
### NOS WK06: Internet Layer (IP & DHCP)
- **Key Topics Covered:** IP addressing, subnetting, DHCP
- **Exercises:**
 - Implemented IP address analysis and subnet calculations
 - Simulated a DHCP server-client model in Python
 - Developed a subnetting plan for a company network
- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 import ipaddress
 net = ipaddress.ip_network('192.168.1.0/24', strict=False)
 print(f"Network: {net.network_address}, Broadcast: {net.broadcast_address}")
 ```
### NOS WK07: Network Access Layer (Error Detection & Correction)
- **Key Topics Covered:** Error detection, parity bits, checksum validation
- **Exercises:**
 - Implemented single-bit and two-dimensional parity checks
 - Simulated error detection and correction methods
 - Developed a one?s complement checksum for data verification
- **Code Samples:**
 ```python
 def compute_even_parity(data):
 return sum(data) % 2
 data = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
 print(f"Parity Bit: {compute_even_parity(data)}")
 ```
